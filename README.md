# 2d-Array-Operations
2D Array (Matrix) Operations Program
This C program provides a menu-driven interface to perform various operations on 3x3 matrices, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition. The program operates on two user-defined matrices (A and B) and displays the results of the selected operations.
Features

Addition: Compute the sum of two 3x3 matrices (A + B).
Subtraction: Compute the difference of two 3x3 matrices (A - B or B - A).
Multiplication: Compute the product of two 3x3 matrices (A * B).
Transpose: Compute the transpose of either Matrix A or Matrix B.
Display: Show the input matrices and the result of operations.
Exit: Terminate the program.

Prerequisites

A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
Basic knowledge of C programming and command-line interface.

How to Run

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>


Compile the Program:
gcc -o matrix_ops main.c


Run the Program:
./matrix_ops


Follow the Prompts:

Enter elements for two 3x3 matrices (A and B) when prompted.
Choose an operation (1-5) from the menu.
For subtraction and transpose, select the specific operation (e.g., A - B or B - A).
View the results and repeat or exit.



Example Usage
Enter elements for Matrix A (3x3):
Element [0][0]: 1
Element [0][1]: 2
Element [0][2]: 3
Element [1][0]: 4
Element [1][1]: 5
Element [1][2]: 6
Element [2][0]: 7
Element [2][1]: 8
Element [2][2]: 9
Enter elements for Matrix B (3x3):
Element [0][0]: 1
Element [0][1]: 1
Element [0][2]: 1
Element [1][0]: 1
Element [1][1]: 1
Element [1][2]: 1
Element [2][0]: 1
Element [2][1]: 1
Element [2][2]: 1

File Structure

main.c: The main C source file containing the program logic.

Notes

The program is designed for 3x3 matrices only, as defined by the SIZE macro.
Input validation is minimal; users should enter valid integers for matrix elements.
The program runs in an infinite loop until the user selects the "Exit" option (5).
Matrix operations follow standard linear algebra rules (e.g., matrix multiplication is computed as per the dot product).
